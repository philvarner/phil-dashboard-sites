# dashboard-sites-template

This repository is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow and group of sites configuration files that
generates and stores a `<stage>-sites-metadata.json` file for use in the dashboard-api-starter.

## Configuration

The `sites` directory contains a directory for each site. Within each site directory, there are two files:
1. site.json - a description of the site
2. summary.html - an HTML fragment that's used as the summary description for this site in the dashboard

Each site directory must be included in the `SITES` array in config.yml. 

The `global` site is used for the default global dashboard configuration.

## Usage

### Manual Execution

This will copy the file to the S3 location indicated in `BUCKET` and print the final JSON description.

1. Update config.yml with the appropriate BUCKET and SITES configuration
2. Export a shell variable for `STAGE`, e.g., `export STAGE=local`
3. Run the sites generator.

```bash
export STAGE=local
python sites_generator/main.py | jq .
```

### Execution via GitHub Actions

1. In the GitHub repository, add secrets (Settings -> Secrets) for accessing AWS (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
2. Update config.yml with the appropriate BUCKET and SITES configuration.
3. Push config.yaml to GitHub and verify it runs correctly. Note only branches configured in `.github/workflows.yml` will run the workflow (e.g. generate the sites metadata files).
